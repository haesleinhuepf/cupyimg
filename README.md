# :warning: IMPORTANT UPDATE (April 13, 2021) :warning:

Development of the `cupyimg.skimage` module in this repository has moved to a
new open source RAPIDS project called [cuCIM] that was created by a
collaboration between [Quansight] and [NVIDIA]. The
`cucim.skimage` module there is an updated equivalent of `cupyimg.skimage`.
The new repository has continuous integration testing on GPUs and generates
binary packages via conda-forge. It also involves incorporation of additional
image I/O functionality in a separate `cucim.clara` module.

Nearly all functions in `cupyimg.numpy` and `cupyimg.scipy` have been ported
upstream to CuPy and are now available in CuPy >= 9.0.

Please migrate to using cuCIM and/or upstream CuPy in the coming weeks as this
repository will eventually be archived.

# cupyimg: n-d signal and image processing on the GPU

[cupyimg] extends [CuPy] with additional functions for image/signal processing.
This package implements a subset of functions from [NumPy], [SciPy] and
[scikit-image] with GPU support.

These implementations generally match the API and behavior of their
corresponding CPU equivalents, although there are some limited exceptions.
In some cases such as scipy.ndimage equivalents, complex-valued support is
available on the GPU even though it is not present as part of the upstream
library. See additional details under [API Differences](#Differences).

Ideally, NumPy/Scipy function implemented here will be submitted upstream
to [CuPy] itself where they will benefit from a more comprehensive CI
architecture on real GPU hardware and a broader set of maintainers. Currently,
testing of this package on NVIDIA hardware has been done only on an
NVIDIA 1080 Ti GPU using CUDA versions 9.2-10.2. However, it should work for
all CUDA versions supported by the underlying CuPy library.

A more complete list of the implemented functions is available in the section
below on [Implemented Functions](#Implemented).

## Basic Usage

Functions tend to operate in the same manner as those from their upstream
counterparts. If there are differences in dtype handling, etc. these should be
noted within the corresponding function's docstring.

Aside from potential dtype differences, the primary difference with their CPU
counterparts tends to be a requirement for ``cupy.ndarray`` inputs rather than
allowing array-likes more generally. This behavior is consistent with [CuPy]
itself where support for such array-likes is generally disallowed due to
performance considerations. In ``cupyimg`` this ``cupy.ndarray`` rule is not
yet consistently enforced everywhere, so some functions still accept numpy
arrays as inputs and will transfer to the GPU automatically internally via
``cupy.asarray``. Any such automatic coercion should not be relied upon and is
subject to be removed in the future.

An simple example demonstrating applying of a uniform_filter to an array is:

```Python
import cupy as cp
from cupyimg.scipy.ndimage import uniform_filter

x = np.random.randn(128, 128, 128)
y = uniform_filter(x, size=5)
```

## Similar Software

The [RAPIDS] project [cuSignal] provides an alternative implementation of
functions from ``scipy.signal``, including some not currently present here. Like
[cupyimg], it also depends on [CuPy], but has an additional dependency on
[Numba]. One other difference is at the time of writing, [cuSignal] does not
support all of the new ``upfirdn`` and ``resample_poly`` boundary handling
modes introduced in SciPy 1.4, while these are supported in [cupyimg].

## Documentation

cupyimg supports Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

**Requires:**

- NumPy (>=1.14)
- CuPy  (>=7.0)
- SciPy (>=1.2)
- scikit-image (>=0.16.2)
- fast_upfirdn (>=0.2.0)

To run the tests users will also need:

- pytest

Developers should see additional requirements for development in
``requirements-dev.txt``.

**Installation:**

Packages for `cupyimg` are not yet on PyPI or conda-forge. Users should first
configure a working CuPy environment. Then cupyimg can be installed from
source.

An example installing cupyimg in a new conda environment is:

```
conda create -n cupyimg python=3.7
conda activate cupyimg
conda install numpy scipy scikit-image pytest cudatoolkit
pip install cupy-cuda101
pip install fast_upfirdn
pip install https://github.com/mritools/cupyimg/archive/master.zip
```

where cupy-cuda101 in the above will need to be changed to the appropriate
version for the user's CUDA toolkit. See
[CuPy's documentation](https://docs-cupy.chainer.org/en/stable/install.html#install-cupy).


**Example**
```Python
import numpy as np
import cupy
import scipy.ndimage as ndi
from cupyimg.scipy.ndimage import uniform_filter
#from cupy.time import repeat

d = cupy.cuda.Device()
# separable 5x5x5 convolution kernel on the CPU
x = np.random.randn(256, 256, 256).astype(np.float32)
y = ndi.uniform_filter(x, size=5)
# %timeit y = ndi.uniform_filter(x, size=5)
#    -> 935 ms ± 69.2 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

# separable 5x5x5 convolution kernel on the GPU
xg = cupy.asarray(x)
yg = uniform_filter(xg, size=5)
# %timeit yg = uniform_filter(xg, size=5); d.synchronize()
#    -> 6.23 ms ± 24.8 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

## API/Behavior Differences

### lack of automatic array coercion

As in CuPy itself, automatic conversion via `cupy.asarray()` is typically not
performed on inputs in order to avoid unintended overheads from host/device
transfers. Thus, many functions only accept CuPy arrays rather than more
general array-likes as input. Enforcing this policy uniformly across `cupyimg`
still needs some work, but in general one should not expected lists, numpy
arrays or other iterables to be acceptable "image" inputs.

### complex dtypes

Many functions in `cupyimg.scipy.ndimage` support complex-valued floating point
dtypes. These are not currently supported in the upstream `scipy.ndimage`
module.

### single precision operations

The functions in `scipy.ndimage.filters` have an additional `dtype_mode`
keyword-only argument. When set to the default value of `ndimage`, convolutions
are performed in double-precision as is done by `scipy.ndimage`. However, on
the GPU single-precision operations are often substantially faster. The user
can specify `dtype_mode='float'` to allow single-precision computations on
single-precision inputs.

### additional keyword-only arguments

`cupyimg.scipy.ndimage.convolve` and `cupyimg.scipy.ndimage.correlate` have a
couple of keyword-only arguments not present in `scipy.ndimage`. These are
experimental and subject to change. For example, a `crop` kwarg allows
performing "full" convolutions instead of one limited to the original image
extent.

### lack of exotic dtype support

Some functions such as `numpy.convolve` support less common dtypes such as
`datetime64` or `Decimal`. These are not supported by upstream CuPy and are
thus not available in `cupyimg` either.
